loading_phrase = <i>Stealin'</i> was written by Uriah Heep's keyboardist, Ken Hensley (who sadly passed away in November 2020). When asked about the lyrics, Ken claimed that there was "nothing really deep to this one" and that it was mostly just the result of having a new perspective after touring America. Despite this, fans continue to analyse the chorus for deeper meaning, unaware that they'll be searching for a long, long time.
